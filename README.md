# URL SHORTENING API LANDING PAGE

## Link Shortener Project

This is a single-page web application for shortening URLs. Users can enter a long URL in the provided field and click the "Shorten It!" button to generate a shortened version.

**Features:**

- Basic URL shortening functionality (using a free external API).
- Responsive layout adapting to different screen sizes.
- Bootstrap framework for styling.
- Clear visual design with a background image and call to action button.

**Technologies Used:**

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (fetch API)

**How to Run:**

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed (for package management).
3. Open a terminal in the project directory.
4. Run `npm install` to install any required dependencies (likely Bootstrap).
5. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

**Note:**

- Replace `'d88b849a4cmsh04efd9b18ada8aep1d098djsnc2838aa47965'` in the code with your own RapidAPI key for the URL shortener service (or consider implementing a different shortening service).

This is a basic implementation and can be extended with features like:

- Handling different URL shortening services.
- Displaying additional information about the shortened URL (e.g., creation date, click count).
- User authentication and account features.
- Error handling and user feedback for various scenarios.

Feel free to explore and customize this project further!
